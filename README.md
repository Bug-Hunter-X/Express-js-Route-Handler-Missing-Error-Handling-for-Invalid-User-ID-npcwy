# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid or unexpected input.  Specifically, the example shows a route that fetches a user by ID but fails to handle cases where the ID is not a valid number.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.

## Bug

The original code attempts to parse the user ID as an integer without any validation.  If the ID is not a number (e.g., a string or a special character), `parseInt(userId)` will return `NaN`, causing the `find()` method to fail silently or throw an error depending on the context. This can lead to unexpected behavior or server crashes.

## Solution

The solution involves adding input validation to ensure the ID is a number before attempting to use it.  It also adds more robust error handling to provide informative responses to the client in case of errors.
